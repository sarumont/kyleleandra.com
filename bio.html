			<p>
			Kyle Leandra Kolkovich grew up on a fibers farm in Woodstock, Georgia, where her family raised goats, llamas, and angora bunnies. She learned at an early age to shear, clean, and even spin her own yarn from the animals her family owned. From there, she picked up all kinds of new hobbies such as weaving, felting, sewing, dyeing, and knitting. Because of her knowledge in the fiber arts, local museums and schools would ask her and her mother to come provide demonstrations. Together, they began doing Civil War reenactments, making their own authentic costumes. She still volunteers at local institutions, teaching those interested about fibers and textiles.<br /><br />

			Kyle graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design with a Bachelors in Fibers (Textile
			Design). Currentnly, she resides in Denver, Colorado with her sweet husband and two adorable,
			fuzzy kitties. She moved to Wichita, Kansas in 2008 to pursue a career as an interior and
			textile designer for private and corporate jets. In 2011, her husband's job moved them to
			Denver, Colorado. In her free time, she is usually found dabbling in new craft mediums. On the side, she makes and sells handmade items for the home.<br /><br />
